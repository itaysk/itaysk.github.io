I will be speaking at Sela Developer Practice (SDP) 2016 - one of the largest developer conferences in Israel.
The event will take place at 19-23 June 2016 at Cinema City in Rishon Letzion.

I will be joining my colleagues Assaf Jacoby and Tomer Rosenthal to delivering the second day keynote (21 June, 09:45) . In the keynote, we will discuss and present recent developer innovations from Microsoft including: Bash on Windows,Â Azure Container Service, Service Fabric, and more... (It's a keynote so no deep dive, just an overview and a short demo)
