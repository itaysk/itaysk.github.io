I will be speaking at the [eBPF Summit](https://ebpf.io/summit-2020) virtual event. I will be giving a 5 minute lightning talk, as all sessions in this conference are "lightning talks".

Here are the details:

Tracing and detecting malware using eBPF

In this talk we present how we use eBPF to trace container images in a sandbox, in order to detect malicious behavior that might appear later at runtime. We will present an open source tool that we have built for that task, and how we analyze the system level activity to produce applicative security insights.
