I will be speaking at the next CNCF Tel Aviv meetup in January 28, at IBM office in Tel Aviv.
I'm co-presenting with Yaniv Agman, a security researcher colleague from Aqua Security. Over the past few weeks Yaniv and I have been working on a eBPF tracing tool - Tracee ([https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee)). This talk will be an introduction to eBPF Linux technology, a review of use cases and tools that use eBPF, and finaly introduce Tracee.
