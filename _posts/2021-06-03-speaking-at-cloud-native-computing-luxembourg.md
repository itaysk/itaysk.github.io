I'll be speaking (virtually) at [Cloud Native  Computing Luxembourg meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Luxembourg-Kubernetes-and-CNCF-Meetup) about Aqua Security's Open Source projects and agenda. I'll share a bit about why and how we make open source software, and then give a demo overview of our highlight open source projects.

See you at June 17th, 5pm Luxembourg local time: [https://www.meetup.com/Luxembourg-Kubernetes-and-CNCF-Meetup/events/278396387/](https://www.meetup.com/Luxembourg-Kubernetes-and-CNCF-Meetup/events/278396387/).
