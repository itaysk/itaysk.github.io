[eCHO - eBPF & Cilium Office Hours](https://github.com/isovalent/eCHO), is a live stream hosted by by the Isovalent folks about all things related to eBPF. I'll be joining this week's show to talk about runtime security using Tracee, and other eBPF related miscellaneous.

Join us on Friday, 23 July 2021, 16:00 Israel Time. [https://youtu.be/aOgidMoPz9A](https://youtu.be/aOgidMoPz9A)
