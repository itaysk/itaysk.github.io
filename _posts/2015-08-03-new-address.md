Hi, I've changed the primary address of the blog from blog.itayasaservice.com to blog.itaysk.com .

Why change? cause the old one was too long and when written in lowercase didn't make good initial impression.
Why itaysk? it's a domain I already own and use for other stuff. It's suppoed to stand forÂ **ITAY S**ha**K**ury.

Also: New Theme! yey
