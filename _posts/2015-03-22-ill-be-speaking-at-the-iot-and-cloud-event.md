Talk about a short notice.. :) Tomorrow (23 March 2015) CVCon and CodeValue are hosting a conference at Cinema City Glilot about IoT and the cloud. 
That was published a while ago, but just a couple of days ago I was asked to help under a short notice and deliver Microsoft's IoT pitch.

So I will be delivering the closing session about Microsoft's doings in the IoT space and roadmap.

Here's the invite:
