I have moved my blog from Wordpress.com to GitHub Pages and Jekyll! 
Here's some background:

I have had this blog on Wordpress.com for a few years now, and have been generally happy. Still, this was sitting with me for a while: 

 Why not Wordpress.com:

- Becuase I had some minor technical issues.
- Because I wanted more control over my blog.
- Becuase I am paying there, and still they have ads in my blog of which I get no profit share.
- Becuase I like the idea of [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html).

Why GitHub Pages:

- Because it's what the cool kinds are doing these days.
- Becuase GitHub is well known with developers and since this is a tech blog it makes sense.
- Because it's free and easy.

Now, GitHub Pages is just a hosting option. You basically put files in a git repo and they are served out of a github.io domain. 
Quesion is - what's the CMS that will generate those static files for you, including styles, layouts, and so on...
Turns out there are quite a few static site generators out there, and you have to choose. Sites like [staticgen.com](http://staticgen.com) can help, but it's up to you to decide.
As you know by now, I chose [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Why Jekyll:

- Because it's the most popular static site generator.
- Because it moves rapidly and has a good community.
- Becuase it's the only one that's natively supported with GitHub pages (they run Jekyll).

I must say - I am not a Ruby guy and never has been. This was not an easy choice for me, but still I am happy with Jekyll. I even created my own theme for Jekyll which wasn't hard at all.

In the next post I will document this journey from a technical perspective.
