I'll be hosting a live "Office Hours" in the Aqua booth at Kubecon EU 2021. I'll talk about Tracee and Runtime Security, and will take your questions live! so [stop by the booth](https://kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe.com/virtual-exhibitor/?v0326b739525aaf6a5900c153ea6485e67109462e8db159b156161fc07c7e3d8016769932b4c0398e64b5ea52edb3d1c5=9ABD4E38A02222692909FA8BACE23C62FA8112168EBB13214E1988E04BC2B96A32196F1859CCEB692D1D4FE44D270623) at Wednesday May 5, 2021, 09:30 - 10:00 Europe/Paris (CEST).

P.S, I'll also be making a quick appearance at the [Cloud Native Security Day opening section](https://sched.co/iRnc). Just a quick overview and welcoming for the day.
