Following the tradition, We will have another meeting of the Microsoft CTO Breakfast Club, with a customer sharing it's architecture on Azure.
This time we will have a special guest - Scott Guthrie (the man in charge of all Azure)!

Right after Scott's session,Â me and my colleague Yaron Schneider will host a "CTO Corner" session, where 2 startups will join us on stage for brainstorming their architecture on Azure.
