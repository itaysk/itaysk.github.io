I'll be speaking at [DevSecCon24 2021](https://www.devseccon.com/devseccon24-2021/) about "Runtime Security using eBPF and OPA". The talk is about [Tracee](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tracee), of course, and I'll try to highlight the unique aspects of the engine which brings eBPF and OPA together.

See you at June 24th, 12pm UTC: [https://events.bizzabo.com/308842/agenda/speakers/1185123](https://events.bizzabo.com/308842/agenda/speakers/1185123).
