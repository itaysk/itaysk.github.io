I'll be speaking at eBPF Summit 2021:

OSS Licensing considerations for eBPF projects

Open source licensing is often overlooked by developers who prefer to focus on the code. They may quickly choose a good permissive license and never look back. However, it may not be as simple as that, especially when working on eBPF code, there are important nuances to understand. In this talk we will discuss the common open source licensing types and their relationship with linux/eBPF related licensing. We'll use a real use case from licensing our open source project Tracee.
