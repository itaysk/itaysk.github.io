I will be speaking at Kubecon Amsterdam 2020, together with Amir Jerbi (CTO at Aqua Security). Our session in essense will be about the importance of runtime security for cloud native workloads. We will look into the shortcomings of container image scanning today, and will discuss/demonstrate what is the next step beyond image scanning.
