I'm joining as co-host of Cloud Native live for a few months!

Cloud Native Live is the CNCF weekly live stream for people to learn hands on about CNCF projects and members. The real world is rarely like a "how to" blog post where everything is greenfield and works out of the box. Cloud Native Live allows the cloud native community to dig into these problems in real time and see how people solve them.

Cloud Native Live will stream across CNCF Twitch, Youtube Live, and LinkedIn. In addition to the chat functionality on each platform, there is a channel in CNCF slack where audience members can ask questions before, during, and after the show to engage more with the presenters.
