I will be speaking at the [Cloud Native Security Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/cloud-native-security-day-north-america/), as part of [Kubecon North America 2020](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/). 

Here are the details:

Dynamic Image Scanning Through System Tracing

As security practices and tools for application scanning are becoming increasingly popular, malicious actors are introducing sophisticated techniques to obfuscate their intent and evade those scanning tools. The malware they create cannot be detected using static analysis or signatures, but dynamic analysis that runs the application and observes its activity can trace the entire chain of events and help you detect those threats.  In this talk we introduce Dynamic scanning and discuss how it relates to two other security approaches: Static scanning and Runtime security. We will then show how operating system tracing is key to implementing dynamic scanning as we explore common behavioral patterns of malware, and discuss how these threats can be uncovered using open source tools.
