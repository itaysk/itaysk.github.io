Azure Tour is the biggest Azure focused event of the year. It is running all around the world, and it is coming to Tel-Aviv on December 2, 2015.
See more details and register here: [https://microsoft.eventcore.com/azuretour/telaviv/](https://microsoft.eventcore.com/azuretour/telaviv/)

We will be running a side track during the event focused on BDMs (Business Decision Makers) - where me and my team will give a session called "Innovation in Azure" that will cover a lot of cool topics and demos.
Registration is open and free (for the general track). Hope to see you there!
